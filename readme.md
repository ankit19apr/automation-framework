# Test Automation Framework



This is a Java-based test automation framework.



The framework leverages various libraries and tools to facilitate data-driven testing, logging, reporting, and integration with cloud-based testing platform like lambdatest.

## Setup Instructions



**Clone the Repository:**



```bash

  git clone https://github.com/ankit19apr/automation-framework.git



  cd automation-framework

```

    



**Running Tests on LambdaTest:**



```bash

     mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X



```





**Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode:**



```bash

     mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X



```



## Reports & Logs

-Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html. 



The report contains information on test cases executed, passed, failed, and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.



## Logs: 

Logs are created during the test execution and stored in the ./logs/ directory. 



## Integrated the project Github Actions 

This automation framework is integrated with github actions.

The tests will be executed at 09:00AM IST every single day. 



The reports will be archieved in gh-pages branch
